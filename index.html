      <h2>THE PLUSHY FAMILY</h2>
        <p>(AAA#ooc-010532, 66 min, 2018, Berlin)</p>
    is an experimental eye-witness documentary, portraying people’s thoughts,
    interactions and experiences with social media platforms and a  personalised
    internet. The movie shows in a synchronised two camera perspective a turn based
    un-moderated many people conversation.
    As filter bubbles pop, fake news loom in clouds of smoke, surveillance is over
    present, personalised data is extracted and deep machine learning exploits
    privacy, today´s opinions loop in echo chambers. While old arguments get
    deconstructed and a new inter subjective awareness is emerging, the audience has
    the privilege to reflect on “what was the Now and what has the Now become”.
    The montage technique and camera concept are an experimental approach that
    aimed for a novel narrative form, in order to sustain a higher attention of the
    audience to follow complex spoken arguments and chains of thought.The material
    was recorded in winter 2017, before the disclosure of the Facebook Cambridge
    Analytica data scandal, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), before
    the European Commission’s fine on Google for breaching EU antitrust rules and so
    on and so forth. The ongoing progress in social media platforms and the surrounding
    debate deconstruct an imprint of a past assertive claim recorded in “The Plushy
    Family”
